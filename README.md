## configuring project on servers without SSH

Assuming the project's **LOCAL** root directory is: `C:\php\www\sorteandoaqui` and the **HOSTING** root directory is: `/home/bfweb/public_html`, with the command `Ctrl+F` find and replace all configuration generated by the dump using the hosting root instead of the local root.

Occurrences:

1. C:\\\php\\\www\\\sorteandoaqui\\\storage\\\
2. C:\\\php\\\www\\\sorteandoaqui\\\resources\\\
3. C:\\\php\\\www\\\sorteandoaqui\\\public\\\storage

Example as it is:

```php
'path' => 'C:\\php\\www\\sorteandoaqui\\storage\\framework/cache/data'
```

Example how it should look:

```php
'path' => '/home/bfweb/public_html/storage/framework/cache/data',
```

## About .HTACCESS settings

If you have full access to all settings on your hosting server, it is possible to perform all settings there, such as forcing HTTPs, removing <WWW>. and etc.

if this is not possible, just uncomment the lines in the file: `public\.htaccess`
